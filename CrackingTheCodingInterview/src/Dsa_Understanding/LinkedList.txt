LinkedList Understanding:

A LInked list is a linear data structure used to store collections of Objects. A linked list is made
up of individual nodes which are present at diff memory locations. They need not be contiguous like
arrays. These nodes are linked to each other. A node is made of Data and link to next Node.

The first node in a linked list is called the head and the last node is the tail. The link of the tail
node always points to null, to show that it is the end of the linked list.

Linked list implementation:

The node which says head refers the start of the list and tail refers the end of the list.

public class LinkedList{
	Node head;
	Node tail;
//	Setters and getters
}
public class Node{
	String/int/char data;
	Node next;					//Object of the node; 
//  Setters and getters
}

We have five main Operations: addAtEnd, addAtBeginning, display, find, insert, delete
